- Description: Given a set $\Omega$ and a positive semidefinite kernel function $K:\Omega\times\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, Mercer's theorem guarantees a unique RKHS $\mathcal{H}$ such that $K$ is the kernel for $\mathcal{H}$. The feature map $\phi:\Omega\rightarrow \mathcal{H}$ defined by $\phi(x)=k_x$ induces a feature map $\psi:M^1(\Omega)\rightarrow \mathcal{H}$ (where $M^1(\Omega)$ is the set of probability measures on $\Omega$) defined by $\psi(\mu)(z) = \int k_z(x) d\mu(x)$. This mapping gives us a lot of nice properties. In particular, it lets us deal with functions on the set of measures more easily. This can be applied to modern portfolio theory, where portfolios are modeled as measures on the set of assets. This allowed us to find an efficient algorithm for finding the efficient frontier.

##### Frost Research Associate - *California Polytechnic State University*
(March 2023 - June 2024)
- Advisor: Dr. Vincent Bonini
- Description: Given a prime $p$ and $n, k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $p^n \equiv 1 \mod{2k}$ (or $\mod{k}$ if $p = 2$), the generalized Paley graph of order $p^n$ under $k$-residues is $\mathcal{P}(p^n, k) = (V,E)$ where $V=\mathbb{F}\_{p^n}$ is the field of order $p^n$ and $E=\lbrace(x,y) \colon \exists \text{ } \alpha \in \mathbb{F}\_{p^n}^\times$ such that $x-y=\alpha^k\rbrace$. These graphs have many interesting properties, but the main one we wanted to study is their patterns in condensed Ricci curvature (a modification of Ollivier Ricci curvature on graphs). Based on an algorithm developed by a previous research group, we were able to find an explicit formula for the condensed Ricci curvature about any edge in $\mathcal{P}(p^n, k)$ so long as $k|\frac{p^n-1}{p-1}$.

#### Other Experience

##### Junior Software Developer Engineer - *Amazon*
(January 2022 - January 2023)
- Manager: Kim Nico
- Description: The Junior SDE program is a selective program hosted by Amazon to train young motivated software engineers. It is a year-round internship; part-time during the school year, and full-time over the summer. I received 1:1 mentoring throughout the program and learned a lot about computer science. Some of the projects I worked on included front-end web development for internal tools and the migration of an internal service to an AWS Lambda service.
